## My process

### Built with

- Atom developer tool


### What I learned

Working on this project has helped me put my css skills to work especially when dealing with 'position', deciding whether to use relative or absolute. Although
i'm not sure if it's applicable in all areas of the project but i used it anyway.


### Continued development

I still feel i need more work on how to position elements as well as studying more css rules. Also, i'll be focusing on the use of margins and borders too.


### Useful resources

- (https://convertingcolors.com/) - This helped me for coverting color codes from hsl to hex. I really don't know how to use colors in hsl formats so i had to convert to more suitable color codes. I really liked this website and will use it going forward.
